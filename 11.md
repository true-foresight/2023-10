## Intellectual Properties Stolen by US Institutes 


Which intellectual property or properties (IP) have been stolen, by which agencies, and where is the proof, you ask?

I am glad that you asked! 

So, let us review the following materials that provide evidence of how entities like US-Department of Defense (US-DOD) along with its appendages such as Office of Naval Research (US-ONR) and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), have habitually misappropriated IP belonging to international students and workers via North American universities and colleges:

- The case of thousands of misappropriated IP through the deliberate use of improper employment contracts among state-sponsored units like University of Iowa, Iowa, USA, as a prototypical case that generalizes to other institutes in the US and Canada: https://github.com/true-hindsight/long-overdue-justice/blob/main/expose/03-0.md#3-violations-of-workers-intellectual-property-and-moral-rights-via-north-american-universities   

- The indisputable hard evidence: https://github.com/true-hindsight/long-overdue-justice/tree/main/reference/files 

- The subsequent use of those illegitimately obtained technologies and work outputs incorporated into commercial, industrial or military applications, that have been and are being transferred to countries like Ukraine and Israel, across international borders: https://github.com/true-hindsight/long-overdue-justice/blob/main/expose/04-0.md  

    - Worst of all, those expropriated commercial, industrial, and military systems have been, and are being willfully used for killing unarmed civilians in various countries where they have been sold or deployed by US-led research and development (R&D) groups.  

All of the above materials have been provided via GitHub so that it is transparent to the public that the files do not contain any operating system level executable computer code, or any other type of viral cyber-attack vectors. 

Now, of all the people, it certainly isn't my designated job or duty to physically assemble a United Nations (UN) committee, or an army of lawyers in Qatar, to look into this long-standing injustice amounting to Tens of Billions of Euros owed by US-DOD to local as well as international entities throughout the world, due to such ongoing violations of international laws.

You might agree that an "International, Rules Based Order" cannot exist, and nor can it ever be legally reified, if countries like USA and Canada keep shamelessly breaking the laws, rules, norms, and conventions that they would like to impose upon all other countries, instead of firstly apply those very same statutes to themselves and to their entire range of activities. 

### Calculating The Compound Interest on Debt Owed by US and Canada

How must the annually compounding interest on the debts owed by North American state-sponsored institutes for unpaid royalties and damages be calculated? 

Let us look at the justifications used by underwriters and mercantile bankers, for setting the value of interest rate ascribed to Credit Card debt, in order to answer the above question. 

Supposedly, the risk to creditors in recovering debt from absconding Credit Card loan defaulters who keep evading prosecution, is of such a magnitude, that an annual floating interest-rate of nearly 20% annually compounding fee, is ascribed to Credit Cards issued by financial underwriters. Indeed, the process of recovering debt from individuals or corporations who have defaulted on their financial obligations and promises, can involve serious risks and losses. So, would you say that recovering debt from the whole of the US government including its allies, would be riskier than chasing after an individual or a business corporation? 

If you were to say that, compared to recovering Credit Card or household debt involving securities and loans, the risk involved in recovering debt from the US government and its allied groups for misappropriated technologies and IP rights, is "N times" greater then the annual compounding interest on Credit Card debt, then, the required fees for the purposes of recovering all owed debts to students and workers accumulated by North American institutes, needs to be at least, "N times the putative, annually compounding interest-rate", of things like vehicle or Credit Card loans.  

Of course, the calculated interest-rates have to be measured from the date of said theft, which can be estimated as the date students and workers were taken undue advantage of upon being hired by North American institutes, via dubiously improper and critically faulty employment contracts.  

**Quite urgently and importantly:** Managers, officials, and business leaders among those problematic institutes, and especially government officials in Canada and the US, need to comprehend that the title of, *"absconding debtor",* is still overshadowing all of their work and family related titles, as well as all reputation based privileges they have possessed or garnered, till date. 

Therefore, might I suggest that, Canadian and American governments can have each and every one of their registered and state-regulated institutes, digitize and upload all of their employment records available from the earliest dates possible in an orderly fashion, to publicly accessible and version controlled online repositories, so that those records can be verified and efficiently vetted through globally crowd-sourced efforts. Authentic and appropriate employment contracts used by those responsible institutes, can thus be appraised and separated from all the improper and faulty ones that have lead to any type of a theft or a violation on part of those institutes, involving: copyrights, IP, or other similar rights to compositions and work outputs, including the moral rights contained therein, that otherwise legally belong to local or international persons. 

**Most importantly:** Fulfilling the above-mentioned steps in strict sincerity, and in the most transparent as well as publicly demonstrable way, would be a worthwhile gesture towards a show of good-faith, in order for responsible North American entities to be able to earn some respect and forgiveness from the people who are still owed remedies and reparations. 

Ultimately, by paying the owed debts, in full, to the satisfaction of all wronged, injured, or harmed persons whose IP rights have been or have continued to be violated, will this matter be resolved. 

In the mean time, all delays and deflections shored up by North American entities in properly redressing this matter, will only result in escalations that will not be merely limited to, Canada's and USA's credit ratings being marked as "subprime." 


### Being Where The Puck is About to Go to Next

You might have heard a Canadian idiomatic expression, rightly or wrongly attributed to Wayne Gretzky, about intercepting the market, I mean, an ice hockey puck, at its future trajectory. 

Gretzky had some reasonable foresight, didn't he? Yes, Gretzky had foresight or something, alright.

However, while some people go to where the proverbial puck is going to be, there are other people like myself who sit around at a place where a hockey rink is yet to be built, because chasing after things or being chased after by fans, is simply not that interesting anymore. Even from where I am, I can estimate that in the coming months and years, the assortment of international-level sabotage and separatism based groups like the GÃ¼len Movement, the Khalsa Movement,  and the Falun Gong Movement, will be taken down by mandated international counter-terrorism agencies with the aid of American and Canadian security agencies, once and for all. 

Those types of terrorism and separatism based organizations being incubated in, and directed from North America by certain North American entities against countries like India, Turkey, and China, will not be allowed to stand for much longer. 

The predicate and legal justification that is likely to be used by countries like Turkey, India, and China will be the example of Israeli and Palestinian history, which people in the rest of the world don't want repeated within their own countries by terror groups that are still being given funding, protection, training, and passive or active support through government and non-government entities in North America, by American and Canadian authority figures and media groups.

So, let us consider what is truly in store for American and Canadian institutes, that have misappropriated the work outputs and IP of international students and workers. 

You might wonder, at a time when so many human lives are in mortal danger and in severe peril due to ongoing armed conflicts, is it necessary to prioritize the work on remedying stolen R&D materials of international students and workers? Yes, it is because those stolen materials have directly found their way into commercial, industrial, and military supports previously used in, and currently being used within the ongoing armed conflicts in places like Ukraine, Mali, Israel, Yemen, and various other countries. The loss of civilian lives and the ecological destruction generated by those misappropriated properties, has only continued to increase, with each passing day. Such large-scale crimes against humanity must be halted immediately through an injunction on the sale, transfer, and use of those illegitimately obtained systems.

Perhaps the only way for a life to matter and to have meaning, is for it to be cherished by the person who experiences it as their own. Such an individual is then only able to guess that another person's life, liberties, properties, and rights are important, via their relationship with the other person. 

I don't have a particularly close relationship with any individual in North America, anymore. The main reason being the murderous and surreptitiously targeted activities of Canadian state-sponsored operatives and agencies, that destroyed my home and relationships, and even caused the death of my child. Their industrially orchestrated attacks that have continued to be directed in an unrepentant manner, out of their hatred towards Muslims and bigoted prejudices against peoples of color, cannot be forgiven nor forgotten.  

Am I some type of a secret think-tank or a lobbying agency that keeps launching eye-watering write-ups into the void of Twitter? No. I only use Twitter because I am too hapless to understand how Instagram and Tick-Tock are supposed to work. Plus, if I merely wanted to vent or hurl 'conspiracy theories' as a punter, I would have taken to Reddit and wouldn't have bothered to create an automated schedule to upload the remaining DARPA project files I happen to have. No, those files don't have any state-secrets. Relax. They only have the same content as the materials which have already been published in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. However, those files do have meta-data, which may or may not be useful to analysts.   

So, Am I some type of a veiled-authority figure who is able to set pieces of dominoes over a period of months or years, only to topple them and have events like a number of Canadian diplomats get tossed out of India, precisely on the 10th of October? No, not at all. That would be preposterous! Canadian government officials managed to shoot themselves in the foot, all by themselves using the Nijjar incident. Instead of investigating whether Hardeep Singh Nijjar was killed by youngsters from other rival factions within the Khalsa Movement, Trudeau insisted on ginning up the incident against the Indian government, as a political maneuver, just before the upcoming elections in Canada, while trying to make Nijjar look like a Canadian martyr of a noble cause. 

Supporting terror-groups and violent organizations being incubated within Canada, that have vowed to take away large swaths of lands from Pakistan and India using militaristic force to create "a Vatican" or "a Jerusalem" for the Khalsa Sect of Sikhism, isn't a noble cause. Even other Sikh community members acknowledge that a proper and earnest Sardar, would never acquire anything via begging, murder, extortion, armed assaults, or thefts. 

As you can see, I am not some kind of a provocateur, nor am I trolling or spamming North American institutes. Leaders and managers of those institutes need to be held accountable, and their ongoing wrongful activities need to halted completely. Those leaders and mangers must stop cajoling themselves by assuming that all of this is anything but serious business, that is going to keep escalating in its seriousness. Certainly, if they are still wishing and hoping that all of this is merely some type of a hoax, or that this is an endeavor which cannot reach material finality, then they ought to wish and pray harder, or go find a god who will bother to listen to their prayers and wishes. 

Indeed, I am merely an amateur human who has nothing to loose alongside no conceivable need to impress any persons what-so-ever. But, I'm not yet an individual who has nothing to loose, *and* nothing to gain. 

The types of people who have nothing to loose or gain, from any possible future outcome, cannot be negotiated with, and they can only be trusted to turn into petards. It is unfortunate that North Americans do seem to get extremely vexed or frightened by self-immolating or self-detonating people, who invariably get labeled as militants or terrorists, regardless of the faith community those life-forsaking and death-loving fanatics might claim to belong to. However, when those types of people attack India or Turkey, they are labeled as people seeking to establish their "homeland" via freedom of expression. But talking with bullets and bombs that kill or injure people, is an all together different form of a communication, isn't it?

Oh! And by the way, I was suddenly reminded with mention of armaments that: 

>There is a distinct likelihood of the US experiencing major outages and shortfalls in military as well as economic resources, for being able to simultaneously support Ukraine, Israel, the various countries in the African continent, and Taiwan, within approximately a year or so. Such an overall likelihood exists, mainly because of climate change and North America's aging demographics, whereby elderly and retiring people in North America won't be able to effectively contribute to "a war-time economy" while needing pensions and healthcare support. 
>
>All of those challenges cannot be fully mitigated by North America's existing working age demographic whose equities keep getting stolen by feckless employers. The ongoing UAW strike in North America's auto industry is merely one more example of improper employment practices. Plus, there is the pretense and conceit that plagues numerous North American thought-leaders and parliamentarians, who keep saying ridiculous things like: "We are the greatest country in the world that history has ever known", and that America will never run out of economic resources no matter what the future beholds! 

Immediately after saying those kinds of conceited things during interviews and political rallies, they go onto say things like: "We must *Make America, Great Again!"* 

Of course, one particular person called Bernie Sanders, isn't like those pretentious senators who don't seem to be able to observe and admit to basic ground truths. But then, who among "Republicans" and the so-called "Top One Percentile" of income earners and employers within Canada and the US, genuinely listens to views of people like Bernie Sanders?  

So, are you now able to realize, why this is an important juncture in the turn of events, to prevent wars from reaching mainland Northern America upon those wars spreading to neighboring "blocs of countries" surrounding Ukraine, Syria, and the Indo-Pacific?   

More specifically, are you able to foresee that the US and Canada, have much more to loose, if countries like China and India were to start ignoring international laws concerning copyrights and IP rights, in a reciprocal response to those international laws being constantly violated by non-compliant and non-conforming, hypocritical institutes belonging to the US and Canada? 

Well, actually... 

>Countries like UAE, Singapore, Australia, Japan, South Korea, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Denmark have a whole lot more to loose via globally networked stock markets if they don't manage to squarely **decouple from American and Canadian institutes who are "at fault",** while Russia and Iran have most to gain, if North American and Asian countries were to get into a trade-war by violating international treaties and conventions governing IP rights and copyrights, because of tit-for-tat retaliations. 

By now, even ordinary scholars, news reporters, international correspondents, and journalists ought to be able to foresee the consequences of such eventualities, right?
